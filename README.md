# Number Sensei

[Number Sensei](http://numbersensei.com) is a direct result of the lack of engaging software for extracurricular math in American K-12 education. When I tried in math club in high school, it was nigh impossible to understand the content because it was very organized, very disengaging, or very hard for mere humans (much less kids) to read. As a result, I was allergic to mental math despite loving it oh so dearly in elementary. Now I am back with a vengeance to rectify this grievous error.

Our content is based on popular math competitions like the Number Sense, Mathematics, and Science contests held in real school systems.
