<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">A.&nbsp; Usually
when dealing with colored balls, we are only going to be working with 2
different colors.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">B.&nbsp; Like
working with <a href="cards.htm">cards</a>, many times a question will use the
phrase &quot;with replacement&quot; to mean the balls are replaced before
drawing a different ball.&nbsp; If no phrase is specified, it is assumed to be
&quot;without replacement&quot;.</p>

Problems of this type are usually fairly easy if you understand the concept of <a href="prob_to_odds.htm">probability</a>.&nbsp;
The numerator is the number of desirable possibilities while the denominator is
all possibilities.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [1]&nbsp; 2
Balls are drawn from an urn containing 5 red balls and 7 white balls.&nbsp; What
is the probability they are both white?</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 1in">In the 1<sup>st</sup> draw, we have
    a probability of <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub>, because we have 7 possibilities
    and there are a total of 12 balls.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 1in">In the 2<sup>nd</sup> draw, we have
    a probability of <sup>6</sup>/<sub>11</sub>, because we now have 6
    possibilities and there are now 12-1 balls or 11 balls, since one white ball
    was taken out.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 1in">To find the answer we need to
    multiply: <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> x <sup>6</sup>/<sub>11 </sub>= <sup>7</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
    x <sup>1</sup>/<sub>11</sub> = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>22</sub>.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 1in">The answer is <sup>7</sup>/<sub>22</sub>.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [2]&nbsp; An
urn contains 10 red and x white balls.&nbsp; If the probability of drawing a
white ball is <sup>x</sup>/<sub>24</sub>, then x = ?</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 1in">The numerator has to be the number
    of white balls which is what we are looking for.&nbsp; So if we find the
    number of white balls, we will have the answer.&nbsp; So let's look at the
    denominator.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 1in">The denominator is all
    outcomes.&nbsp; In other words all the balls.&nbsp; If we have 10 red balls,
    then we have 24-10 white balls or 14.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 1in">The answer is 14.</li>
