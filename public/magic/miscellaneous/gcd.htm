        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">A.&nbsp; To find the
        GCD of 2 numbers, by definition, means to find the highest number that
        divides evenly into both numbers.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1]&nbsp; Find the
        GCD of 12 and 18.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; In this
        example, the number 6 is the highest number that goes into both
        numbers.&nbsp; Notice that 3 and 2 also divide both numbers, but the GCD
        is 6.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">B.&nbsp; There are
        some steps we can follow to make finding the GCD easier:</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; First,
        always look to see if the smaller number can divide into the larger
        number evenly.&nbsp; If it can then the smaller number is the GCD.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">2.&nbsp; If not, then
        to make it easier, we can multiply the smaller number by a coefficient
        such that both numbers are relatively close.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">3.&nbsp; Subtract the
        two numbers in step 2.&nbsp; This number will be the starting
        point.&nbsp; If this number can divide into both, then this is the
        GCD.&nbsp; If not, find a divisor of this number that can.&nbsp; If none
        can be found or if this number is 1, then the GCD is 1.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [2]&nbsp; Find the
        GCD of 14 and 42.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; Since 14
        can divide into 42 evenly, 14 is the GCD.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; The answer
        is 14.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [3]&nbsp; Find the
        GCD of 12 and 74.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; Since 12
        cannot divide into 74 evenly, we need to find a number that when
        multiplied by 12 gets close to 74.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; If we
        multiply 12 by 6, we get 72 which is close to 74.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; 74 - 72 =
        2.&nbsp; This is our starting point.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">d.&nbsp; Since 2
        divides into both numbers, 2 is the GCD.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">e.&nbsp; The answer
        is 2.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [4]&nbsp; Find the
        GCD of 13 and 56.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; Since 13
        cannot divide into 56 evenly, we need to find a number that when
        multiplied by 13 gets close to 56.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; If we
        multiply 13 by 4, we get 52 which is close to 56.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; 56 - 52 =
        4.&nbsp; This is our starting point.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">d.&nbsp; Since 4
        does not go into 13 evenly, we need to find a factor of 4 that
        does.&nbsp; The factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.&nbsp; The only one that
        divides into both numbers is 1.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">e.&nbsp; The answer
        is 1.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">&nbsp;</p>
