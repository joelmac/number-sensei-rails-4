<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">A.&nbsp; There are many
different forms of sequences on Number Sense tests and they can vary
widely.&nbsp; Because of this there is no way of showing every example but I can
show you some things to look for.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">B.&nbsp; Fibonacci Sequence</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; In this sequence,
each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">2.&nbsp; In other
words:&nbsp; 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...&nbsp; (Notice the 3<sup>rd</sup> number is
1+1, the 4<sup>th</sup> is 1 + 2, the 5<sup>th</sup> is 2 + 3, and so on.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [1]&nbsp; The next term of
3, 4, 7, 11, 18,... is _______.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; This sequence
follows the rules of a Fibonacci Sequence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; Therefore, the next
term is 11 + 18 or 29.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; The answer is 29.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">C.&nbsp; Adding A Fixed
Number</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; Some sequences add
the same number to all the terms.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [2]&nbsp; The next term of
5, 11, 17, 23,... is ________.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; In this sequence, 6
is being added to each successive number.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; The next term in
this sequence is 23 + 6 or 29.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; The answer is 29.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">D.&nbsp; Adding A Fixed
Number Alternately</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; Some sequences add
the same number to every other number.&nbsp; (Not always the same number for
each set.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [3]&nbsp; The next term of
3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, ... is _______.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; In this sequence, 3
is added to every other number for both sets: {3,6,9,...} and {4,7,10,...}.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; The next term in
this sequence is 9 + 3 or 12.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; The answer is 12.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [4]&nbsp; The next term of
2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11,... is _______.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; In this sequence, 4
is added to every number for the first set and 3 is added to every number for
the second set:&nbsp; {2,6,10,...} and {5,8,11,...}.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; The next term in
this sequence is 10 + 4 or 14.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; The answer is 14.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">E.&nbsp; Adding Multiples of
a Number</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; Some sequences will
add multiples of a number to each successive term.&nbsp; (i.e. a<sup>n-1</sup>,
where n is the n<sup>th</sup> term).</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [5]&nbsp; The next term of
3, 5, 9, 17, 33,... is _______.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; In this sequence, 2<sup>n-1</sup>
is added to each term:&nbsp; 3+2, 5+2<sup>2</sup>, 9+2<sup>3</sup>,...</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; The next term in
this sequence is 33+2<sup>5 </sup>or 55.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; The answer is 55.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">F.&nbsp; Evaluating an
Expression</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; Perhaps the most
difficult one to recognize is when you have to find the expression to come up
with the next number.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">2.&nbsp; This type of
sequence can vary dramatically.&nbsp; It takes practice to be able to find the
next number.&nbsp; If you can't find it soon, my advice would be to skip it and
come back if you have time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [6]&nbsp; The next term of
2, 5, 14, 41,... is _______.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; In this sequence,
the next term is evaluated by the expression 3x - 1, where x is the previous
number of the sequence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; The next term in
this sequence is 3(41) - 1 or 122.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; The answer is 122.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [7]&nbsp; The next term of
-1, 2, 7, 14, 23,... is _______.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; In this sequence,
the next term is evaluated by the expression n<sup>2</sup> - 2.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; The next term in
this sequence is 6<sup>2</sup> - 2 or 34.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; The answer is 34.</p>
