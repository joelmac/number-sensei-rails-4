<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .6in">1.&nbsp; To
change a number from base 10 to base b you must find the largest power of b that
will go into the number, and write down the number of times it will go into it.
(*Remember that there can be no digit in the number greater than the base.)</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1] 475 =
_________<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; In
this example 6<sup>3</sup> is the largest power and it evaluates to 216, which
goes into 475, 2 times.&nbsp; Write down 2.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .6in">2.&nbsp; To find
the next numbers, multiply the power found in the previous step and the number
of times it goes into the number.&nbsp; Then, subtract this value from the
original number.&nbsp; Then find out how many times the next power goes into
this number and write it down.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1]&nbsp; 475 =
_________<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp;
Multiply 6<sup>3</sup> x 2 which equals 432.&nbsp; Subtract this value from 475
which equals 43.&nbsp; The next power in line is 6<sup>2</sup> which is
36.&nbsp; Since 36 goes into 43, 1 time, write down 1.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .6in">3.&nbsp; Repeat
step 2 until all powers are gone.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1]&nbsp; 475 =
_________<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp;
Multiply 6<sup>2</sup> x 1 which equals 36.&nbsp; Subtract this value from 43
which equals 7.&nbsp; The next power in line is 6<sup>1</sup> which is 6.&nbsp;
Since 6 goes into 7, 1 time, write down 1.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">d.&nbsp;
Multiply 6<sup>1</sup> x 1 which equals 6.&nbsp; Subtract this value from 7
which equals 1.&nbsp; Since 6<sup>0</sup> is the last power we just write down
whatever number is left, which in this case is 1.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">e.&nbsp; The
answer is 2111.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [2]&nbsp; 134 =
_________<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; The
largest power of 5 that goes into 134 is 5<sup>3</sup> which equals 125.&nbsp;
Since 125 only goes into 134, 1 time, we write down 1.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b. Multiply 5<sup>3</sup>
x 1 which equals 125 and subtract this value from 134 which equals 9.&nbsp; The
next power in line is 5<sup>2</sup> which is 25.&nbsp; Since 25 goes into 9, 0
times, we write down 0.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp;
Multiply 5<sup>2</sup> x 0 which is 0 and subtract this value from 9 which is
still 9.&nbsp; The next power in line is 5<sup>1</sup> which is 5.&nbsp; Since 5
goes into 9, 1 time, we write down 1.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">d.&nbsp;
Multiply 5<sup>1</sup> x 1 which is 5 and subtract this value from 9 which is
4.&nbsp; Since 5<sup>0</sup> is the last power we just write down</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">e.&nbsp; The
answer is 1014.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [3]&nbsp; 76 =
_________<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; The
largest power of 2 is 2<sup>6</sup> which is 64.&nbsp; 64 goes into 76, 1 time,
so write down 1.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; 76 -
64 = 12.&nbsp; The next power in line is 2<sup>5</sup> which equals 32.&nbsp;
Since 32 does not go into 12, write down 0.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; The
next power in line is 2<sup>4</sup> which is 16.&nbsp; Since 16 does not go into
12, write down 0.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">d.&nbsp; The
next power in line is 2<sup>3</sup> which is 8.&nbsp; Since 8 goes into 12, 1
time, write down 1.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">e.&nbsp; 12 - 8
= 4.&nbsp; The next power in line is 2<sup>2</sup> which is 4.&nbsp; Since 4
goes into 4, 1 time, write down 1.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">f.&nbsp; 4 - 4
= 0.&nbsp; The next power in line is 2<sup>1</sup> which is 2.&nbsp; Since 2
goes into 0, 0 times, write down 0.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">g.&nbsp; 0 - 0
= 0.&nbsp; Since the last power is 0, we just write down what is left, which is
0.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">h.&nbsp; The
answer is 1001100.</p>
