<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">A.&nbsp;
Multiplying 3 close numbers is similar to<i><a href="multiply_2nums.htm">
Multiplying 2 Large Numbers</a></i>.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">B.&nbsp; In this
problem we can change the outside numbers to be a multiple of ten (by adding or
subtracting numbers) and change the middle number by adding/subtracting the
difference of the other 2 numbers.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; This
method can often times get you beyond the 5% window, so we have to compensate in
some way.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">2.&nbsp; One way
of correcting this is to add an additional number to the middle number for every
3 we had to add or subtract to get the other numbers to be a multiple of
10.&nbsp; (If the difference is less than 3, don't add anything.&nbsp; In other
words round down.)</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">C.&nbsp; Here
are some examples to help explain this better:</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1]&nbsp; 41
x 42 x 43 = __________.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; In this
problem, we can change the first and the third numbers to be 40 and 40 if we
subtract 1 from the first and 3 from the second.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">b.&nbsp; Now we
should add 4 to the middle number (this is because we subtracted 1 and 3).&nbsp;
According to step (2) above, we should add an additional 1, since <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub>
= 1.333... which, rounded down equals 1. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">c.&nbsp; So the
new problem becomes 40 x 47 x 40.&nbsp; This is the same as 1600 x 47 which
equals 75200.&nbsp; See <i><a href="../multiply_numbers/mult_12-19.htm">Multiplying
by 12-19</a></i>.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">d.&nbsp; The
actual answer can be between 70344 and 77748.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [2]&nbsp; 19
x 21 x 23 = __________.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; In this
problem, you could just write 21<sup>3</sup> = 9261, if you had it
memorized.&nbsp; If not do the following:</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">b.&nbsp; Change
the first and third number to 20.&nbsp; If you do this you must add 1 to the
first and subtract 3 from the third.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">c.&nbsp; Since we
added 1 and subtracted 3, the difference that we need to add to the middle
number is 2.&nbsp; To compensate we should add an additional 0 since <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>
rounded down equals 0.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">d.&nbsp; The new
problem becomes 20 x 23 x 20 or 400 x 23 which equals 9200.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">e.&nbsp; The
answer can be between 8719 and 9635.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [3]&nbsp; 23
x 33 x 43 = __________.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; In this
problem, we can change the first number to 20 and the third number to 40 by
subtracting 3 from each number.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">b.&nbsp; We must
add 6 to the middle number and add an additional 2, since <sup>6</sup>/<sub>3</sub>
= 2.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">c.&nbsp; Doing so
gives 20 x 41 x 40 or 800 x 41 = 32800.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">d.&nbsp; The
actual answer can be between 31006 and 34268.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">D.&nbsp; Notice
that in Ex [3], if we had not compensated the answer would have been outside the
5% window.&nbsp; So for problems where there is a large spread, the compensating
will come in handy.</p>
