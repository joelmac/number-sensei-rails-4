<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">A.&nbsp; Square roots are a
common approximation problem and can be somewhat challenging since some educated
guessing is involved.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">B.&nbsp; The good thing about
square roots is we can often get the answer in a somewhat close range.&nbsp;
This method is very similar to <a href="../misc/square_roots.htm">finding the
exact value of a square root</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; Mentally take off
2-digits at a time, starting from the right, until you are left with a
manageable square root (i.e. one that you can find a range of 5 with).&nbsp;
Usually you want 3 or 4 numbers to work with.&nbsp; (*If you are using just 3
numbers you want a range of 1.*)</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">2.&nbsp; Judging from the
value under the square root make an educated guess as to where in the range of 5
it might fall.&nbsp; Write this down.&nbsp; (For details on how to get a range
of 5, see <a href="../misc/square_roots.htm">finding the exact value of a square
root</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">3.&nbsp; Add 1 zero to the
end for every 2 digits you took off from step 1.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [1]&nbsp; <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>(139456)
= __________.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; Taking off 2-digits
at a time, we are left 1394.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; We know 35<sup>2</sup>
= 1225 and 40<sup>2</sup> = 1600.&nbsp; 1394 is closer to 1225 than it is to
1600, so we might want 37.&nbsp; Write 37.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; Add one 0 since we
took off two numbers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">d.&nbsp; We get 370.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">e.&nbsp; The answer can be
between 355 and 392.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">Ex [2]&nbsp; <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>(2439761)
= __________.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; Taking off 2-digits
at a time, we are left with 243.&nbsp; (*Note, there were 4 digits taken off*).</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">b.&nbsp; We know that 15<sup>2</sup>
= 225 and 16<sup>2</sup> = 256.&nbsp; Now we must make an educated guess.&nbsp;
243 is between 225 and 256 so we could use 15.5 for the middle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">c.&nbsp; If we do we would
get 1550 for the answer.&nbsp; (*Notice instead of just adding 2 0's we moved
the decimal over 1 and added 1 zero.*)</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">d.&nbsp; The answer can be
between 1483 and 1640.</p>
<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">C.&nbsp; On problems like Ex
[2], the numbers are large so we have a lot of leniency.&nbsp; You don't have to
take a lot of time on guessing as you should already be close.&nbsp; In Ex[1] we
have smaller numbers but you can see by the range that it is not necessary to
spend a lot of time in making a decision.&nbsp; The guessing is just to get you
closer, just in case. </p>
