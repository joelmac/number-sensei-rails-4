<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">A.&nbsp; These
types of problems will almost always be found on problem #10 and nowhere else.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">B.&nbsp; Since
these problems are approximations you can make it easier and faster on yourself
by rounding some numbers with discretion.&nbsp; A basic rule of thumb is
&quot;the larger the numbers, the more you can round.&quot;</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1]&nbsp; 558
+ 243 - 132 + 69 = __________.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; In this
problem, the numbers are not large but small, so I would round with extreme
discretion.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">b.&nbsp; It is
safe to use:&nbsp; 600 + 200 - 130 + 70, because the first number is less than
600 about the same distance as the second number is greater than 100.&nbsp; You
would get 740.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">c.&nbsp; However,
you could use: 560 + 200 - 100 + 70, because 243 is almost the same distance
from 200 as 132 is from 100.&nbsp; You would get 730. </p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">d.&nbsp; The
answers can be between 702 and 774.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [2]&nbsp;
4589 + 6743 - 1237 + 555 = _________.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; In this
problem, the numbers are larger, so we have a greater leniency.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">b.&nbsp; It is
safe to use:&nbsp; 5000 + 6000 - 1000 + 600, because 4589 is close to the same
distance from 5000 as 6743 is from 6000 and also 1237 is close to 1000 but to
make sure round 555 up.&nbsp; You would get 10600.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">c.&nbsp; The
answer can be between 10118 and 11182.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">C.&nbsp; Many
times there will be numbers on the question that are insignificant and can be
ignored.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [3]&nbsp;
14141 - 1414 - 141 - 14 - 1 = __________.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; In this
problem we are dealing with big numbers and the small ones should be
ignored.&nbsp; The first 2 numbers are the only important ones.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">b.&nbsp; It is
safe to use:&nbsp; 14400 - 1400, since the numbers are relatively big; we have
more leniency.&nbsp; You would get 13000.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">c.&nbsp; The
answer can be between 11943 and 13199.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">D.&nbsp; In
short, there are numerous ways to going about solving these types of
approximations.&nbsp; It takes practice to learn how much you can round.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">E.&nbsp; If you
do not feel comfortable rounding so much (as in Ex [3]), then you can round
first and subtract a little off in the end just to be sure.&nbsp; This practice
saved me a few times.</p>
