<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">A.&nbsp; Modular
math is simply working with MOD.&nbsp; MOD is the remainder after dividing by a
specific value.&nbsp; For example, 35 MOD 3 = 2 since the remainder after 35 is
divided by 3 is 2.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">B.&nbsp; Modular
math works with congruencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that 35 MOD 3 = 2, but it
is also true that this is congruent to 32 MOD 3 or even 26 MOD 3, since they all
produce the same value of 2 after being divided by 3.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">C.&nbsp; In
general, n MOD a <img border="0" src="images/mod.ht5.gif" width="13" height="13"> (n + ab) MOD a, where
b is any integral.&nbsp; So 35 MOD 3 <img border="0" src="images/mod.ht6.gif" width="13" height="13">
(35 + 3b) MOD 3.&nbsp; If b = -4, then we learn that 35 MOD 3 <img border="0" src="images/mod.ht7.gif" width="13" height="13">
23 MOD 3, which we can see is true since they both produce the value 2.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">D.&nbsp; Number
sense uses this in a few different forms.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1]&nbsp; 2x <img border="0" src="images/mod.ht8.gif" width="13" height="13">
3 MOD 7, 0&lt;x&lt;12, then x = _____</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; On
problems like these, think of this as being 2x <img border="0" src="images/mod.ht9.gif" width="13" height="13">
3a + 7.&nbsp; We are looking for a value of a that produces an integer value for
x that is between 0 and 12.&nbsp; Basically, we are adding multiples of 7 to 3
until a value can be found for x in the given range.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">b.&nbsp; Go
through each value mentally (usually starting with 0) until you find a value
that works.&nbsp; With a = 0, we get x = <sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub> which is not
an integer.&nbsp; With a = 1, we get x = 5 which is in the range.&nbsp; So x =
5.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [2]&nbsp; 13<sup>14</sup>
divided by 5 has a remainder of _____</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">a.&nbsp; One
property of MOD's is that a<sup>b</sup> MOD n <img border="0" src="images/mod.ht10.gif" width="13" height="13">
(a MOD n)<sup>b</sup> MOD n.&nbsp; So for this problem, we know that 13 MOD 5 =
3.&nbsp; So we can first think of this as being 3<sup>14</sup> MOD 5.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">b.&nbsp; There are
several ways to go from here.&nbsp; I would probably then say this is equal to 9<sup>7</sup>
MOD 5.&nbsp; We know that 9<sup>0</sup> ends in a 1 and 9<sup>1</sup> ends in a
9.&nbsp; After this the last digit repeats itself.&nbsp; So 9<sup>n</sup> <img border="0" src="images/mod.ht11.gif" width="13" height="13">
9<sup>n MOD 2</sup>.&nbsp; So 9<sup>7</sup> <img border="0" src="images/mod.ht12.gif" width="13" height="13">
9<sup>1</sup> which has a remainder of 4 after dividing by 5.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">c.&nbsp; The
answer is 4.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1in">d.&nbsp; The goal
of these types of problems is to reduce the value using congruencies, until you
get something that is easy to compute.&nbsp; In this case, we got 9 MOD 5.&nbsp;
Sometimes, you can know the answer earlier.&nbsp; It just takes a lot of
practice.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">E.&nbsp;
Sometimes, there are special cases where finding the answer is easier.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; We know
from a theorem (Euler's Totient Theorem) that a<sup>b</sup> MOD b = a, if a and
b are <i><a href="../misc/rel_prime.htm">relatively prime</a></i>.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">Ex [1]&nbsp; 15<sup>17</sup>
MOD 17 = ________</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.5in">a.&nbsp; The
answer is 15 since 15 and 17 are relatively prime.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.5in">&nbsp;</p>
