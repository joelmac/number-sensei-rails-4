<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">A.&nbsp; There
are several different ways of solving two equations with two variables.&nbsp;
This page will focus on only two ways:</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp;
Substitution Method</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">2.&nbsp;
Elimination Method</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">B.&nbsp;
Substitution Method</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; This
method works under the assumption that you can solve for one variable (in terms
of another) and plug this value into the other equation and solve.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">Ex [1]&nbsp; If
2x + y = 5 and 3x + 2y = 9, then x = ___.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.5in">a.&nbsp; In this
problem, the 1<sup>st</sup> equation has a single 'y' so we can solve for y and
get y = 5 - 2x.&nbsp; Now we can substitute this value into the 2<sup>nd</sup>
equation.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.5in">b.&nbsp; Doing
so gives 3x + 2(5 - 2x) = 9.&nbsp; Now we have an equation with one variable so
we can solve for x.&nbsp; This yields: 3x + 10 - 4x = 9 or x = 1.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.5in">c.&nbsp; The
answer is 1.&nbsp; If the problem had wanted the y-value, you substitute x =1
for one of the equations and solve for x.&nbsp; 2(1) + y = 5.&nbsp; So y = 3.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">C.&nbsp;
Elimination Method</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp; To use
this method, you will have to &quot;eliminate&quot; one of the variables by
adding the equations together.&nbsp; Sometimes you have to multiply one equation
by a constant to get the same coefficient (but they must have opposite signs) so
they will cancel each other out.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">Ex [1]&nbsp; If
3x + 2y = 4 and -6x + 3y = 6, then y = ___.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.5in">a.&nbsp; In this
equation, we can eliminate the x variable if we multiply the first equation by 2
and add it to the second equation.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.5in">b.&nbsp; So
multiplying the 1<sup>st</sup> equation by 2 gives: 6x + 4y = 8.&nbsp; Now we
can add the two equations together and get 7y = 14 or y = 2.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.5in">c.&nbsp; The
answer is 2.&nbsp; If the question had asked for the x value we could plug y=2
into one of the equations and solve for x.&nbsp; 3x + 2(2) = 4 or 3x = 0 or x =
0.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">&nbsp;D.&nbsp;
Sometimes the problem can be solved much easier if the 2<sup>nd</sup> equation
is a multiple of the first.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1]&nbsp; If
2x - 3y = 4 then 6x - 9y = ______</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; This
problem is a little different from the ones above, but is much easier.&nbsp; If
you notice the 2<sup>nd</sup> equation is 3 times the 1<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; That
means the answer is 3 x 4 or 12.</p>
