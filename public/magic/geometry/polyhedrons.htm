polyhedron is a 3-dimensional multi-faced figure with uniform sides of identical
shapes.</p>

most common polyhedrons are:</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">1.&nbsp;
Tetrahedron - A tetrahedron has 4 faces all of which are triangles.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">2.&nbsp;
Octahedron - An octahedron has 8 faces all of which are triangles.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">3.&nbsp;
Decahedron - A decahedron has 10 faces all of which are pentagons.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">4.&nbsp;
Dodecahedron - A dodecahedron has 12 faces all of which are pentagons.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">5.&nbsp;

Examples</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [1]&nbsp; An
dodecahedron has how many faces?&nbsp; ______</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; The
answer is 12.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">Ex [2]&nbsp;
Each face of a decahedron has how many sides? ____</p>
<p align="left" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 1.25in">a.&nbsp; Since
each face is a pentagon, each face has 5 sides.</p>
